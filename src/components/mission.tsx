            The mission of sport is to promote physical health, mental strength,
            and social development among individuals of all ages. Sport
            encourages fair play, respect, teamwork, and disciplineâ€”values that
            are essential both on and off the field. It brings people together,
            regardless of background, to foster unity, inclusion, and peace. For
            young people especially, sport is a powerful tool for building
            confidence, leadership, and resilience.
