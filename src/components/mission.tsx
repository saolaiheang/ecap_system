          The mission of sport is to promote physical health, mental strength,
          and social development among individuals of all ages. Sport encourages
          fair play, respect, teamwork, and disciplineâ€”values that are essential
          both on and off the field. It brings people together, regardless of
          background, to foster unity, inclusion, and peace. For young people
          especially, sport is a powerful tool for building confidence,
          leadership, and resilience.
